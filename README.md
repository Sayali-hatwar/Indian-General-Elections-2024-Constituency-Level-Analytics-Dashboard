# Indian-General-Elections-2024-Constituency-Level-Analytics-Dashboard

This project is an ongoing end-to-end data analysis and business intelligence solution that explores the **2024 Indian Lok Sabha (Parliamentary) Election results**. It leverages **SQL** for data modeling and querying, and **Power BI** for dynamic, interactive visual storytelling across 543 constituencies.

## üìå Objective 

To build a powerful, data-driven dashboard that enables stakeholders to:
- Analyze **party-wise** and **alliance-wise** performance (NDA, I.N.D.I.A., Others)
- Explore **state-level** and **constituency-level** results
- Compare **EVM vs postal vote distributions**
- Identify **top candidates**, **winning margins**, and **voter trends**

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies 

- **SQL Server** ‚Äì for data cleaning, joins, window functions, aggregations
- **Power BI** ‚Äì for dashboarding, DAX measures, drill-throughs, filters
- **CSV Dataset** ‚Äì including 5000+ rows across state, constituency, party, and candidate data

## üèóÔ∏è Dataset & Schema

- `constituencywise_details.csv`: Candidate-wise vote details including **EVM votes**, **postal votes**, and **total votes** for each constituency.
- `constituencywise_results.csv`: Contains overall results by constituency, including winning candidate, party, total votes, and margin.
- `partywise_results.csv`: Party-level aggregation of seats won, with alliance mapping.
- `statewise_results.csv`: Maps each parliamentary constituency to its corresponding state.
- `states.csv`: Master list of Indian states with unique `State_ID`.
- SQL joins were created across these tables to allow meaningful analysis via Power BI

## üìä Key Features

- **Landing Page Dashboard**: National-level summary including total seats, alliance performance, and map-based filters
- **Alliance Analysis**: Breakdown of seat share by NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and Others (with custom `party_alliance` field in SQL)
- **State-Wise Drilldown**: Use slicers to explore region-specific results
- **Top Candidates Module**: Identify candidates with the highest EVM votes and winning margins
- **EVM vs Postal Vote Split**: Vote-type distribution across select constituencies
- **Runner-up vs Winner Analysis**: Using window functions in SQL to determine 1st and 2nd positions
- **Custom DAX Measures**: For total seat aggregation, vote margin groups, and dynamic titles

## üß† Sample SQL Operations

- Created derived columns like `party_alliance` for classification into NDA, I.N.D.I.A., and Others
- Used `JOIN`, `CASE`, and `ROW_NUMBER()` to determine rankings and top performers
- Aggregated vote counts, party seats, and state-level summaries
