##  Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL Server** â€“ Data cleaning, joining tables, window functions, and aggregations
- **Power BI** â€“ Dashboarding, DAX measures, drill-throughs, bookmarks, filters
- **CSV Datasets** â€“ 5000+ rows covering states, constituencies, parties, and candidates

##  Dataset & Schema

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `constituencywise_details.csv` | Candidate-level votes (EVM, Postal, Total) |
| `constituencywise_results.csv` | Constituency-level winning candidate and margin |
| `partywise_results.csv` | Party-wise seat counts + alliance classifications |
| `statewise_results.csv` | Maps each constituency to a state |
| `states.csv` | Master list of all Indian states |
| `India_Election_Result.pbix` | Final Power BI dashboard |

Relational joins were established between these files using keys like `Party_ID`, `Constituency_ID`, and `State_ID` to allow a unified data model in Power BI.
